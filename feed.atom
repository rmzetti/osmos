Age-aligned dating brackets
The Answer

Friends of mine in the dating circuit occasionally raise a qualm about a prospective match: Ah! but they are so much older/younger than me! Is that unfair, that I am fishing outside my age bracket?
There are various heuristics to address this problem—e.g. a romantic match is acceptable if
they are older than half your age plus 10 years
if they are within +/- 10 years of your age
etc.
PISH POSH. Comparable ages of romantic partners is a quantitative question so we can SOLVE IT WITH DATA.
This page is the DEFINITIVE answer to optimal dating based on selecting partners’ age in the optimal method: choosing them to be in the same population percentile as yourself.

How can institutions construct good decisions out of the aggregate ignorance, laziness, short-sightedness and chaos that we pump in to them?
A flagship question is is about how the market does so, finding prices (maybe) efficiently despite the boundedly rational dynamics
of human decisions.
re markets systems for
fabricating rational-like behaviour from irrational agents?
(Hayek might argue
this, and I think also Gode and Sunder of Zero Intelligence Agents fame.
Friedman argued that in fact that markets effectively turn people into rational
agents, which is yet stronger.)
Are there useful measures of “how much rationality” humans have that we can use
for aggregate modelling? (as opp. the minute and detailed ones that Kahnemann
and Tversky devise, that are hard to scale up.)

Codeium has been developed by the team at Exafunction to build on the industry-wide momentum on foundational models.

My mentioning and citing material to do with recreational or medical use of controlled substances should obviously not be taken as an endorsement of recreational use of controlled substances.
I am not qualified to make such endorsements, even if I were inclined to.
Indeed, if you are turning to a mathematician for intelligence on legal or pharmacological questions, you should probably inspect your life decisions to see if any other ones you have made recently are similarly suspect.1
So, here are some links about recreational drugs which I find interesting.

For as the sufferings of dimensions abound in us, so our consolation aboundeth through localisation.
Many statistical models are naturally treated as directed Bayesian networks — for example in causal inference I might naturally think about generating processes for my work as a graphical model.
Factor graphs decompose the model differently than the balls-and-arrows DAGs.
Specifically, the factor graph structures the graph with regard to how we would implement method-passing inference, rather than how we would statistically interpret the model.
The result is harder to interpret intuitively but easier to apply practically.

The matrix mathematics side of python is not so comprehensive as MATLAB.
Most of the tools are built on core matrix libraries, numpy and scipy, do what I
want mostly, but when, for example,
I really need some fancy spline type I read
about on the internet, or you want someone to have really put in some effort
on ensuring such-and-such a recursive filter is stable, Igit might find you need
to do it yourself.
numpy though gives us all the classic fortan linear algebra nlibraries.
There are several underlying numerics libraries which can be invoked from python, as with any language with a decent FFI.

Goodhart’s law is an adage named after economist Charles Goodhart, which has been phrased by Marilyn Strathern as “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”
Goodhart first advanced the idea in a 1975 article, which later became used popularly to criticize the United Kingdom government of Margaret Thatcher for trying to conduct monetary policy on the basis of targets for broad and narrow money. His original formulation was:
Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.

Stein’s method meets variational inference via kernels and probability measures.
The result is method of inference which maintains an ensemble of particles which notionally collectively sample from some target distribution.
I should learn about this, as one of the methods I might use for low-assumption Bayes inference.
Let us examine the computable kernelized Stein discrepancy, invented in Q. Liu, Lee, and Jordan (2016), weaponized in Q. Liu, Lee, and Jordan (2016) and summarised in Xu and Matsuda (2021):
Let \(q\) be a smooth probability density on \(\mathbb{R}^{d} .\) For a smooth function \(\mathbf{f}=\) \(\left(f_{1}, \ldots, f_{d}\right): \mathbb{R}^{d} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d}\), the Stein operator \(\mathcal{T}_{q}\) is defined b…]]></summary>

I’m told the experience of HPC on campus is different for, e.g. physicists, who are working on a software stack co-evolved over decades with HPC clusters, and start from different preconceptions about what computers do.

Why bike
tl;dr Riding, as compared to driving a car, makes me rich and happy. YMMV.
I ride to work, and in fact most places.1
This is a good deal.
Let me run the numbers.
My bike costs about AUD500 in maintenance per year, maybe up to AUD1000 if I want to factor in an amortized replacement cost.
Owning a small car costs about AUD6200 per year plus AUD0.16/km I drive in it, plus parking fees.
For my modest commuting needs, the fuel costs would be something like AUD500 at that price.
Parking where I work is astronomically expensive and I won’t even include it here because it would bias the numbers against cars too much.
But wait!

Fediverse: Volunteer-run Twitter.

Drama in your home salon!
This is kinda fun, but not something I’m passionate about.
It is not owned by megacorps which is a plus.
OTOH it has a high maintenance overhead (running a server). It does not help the paranoiac reasons for choosing DIY as is not cryptographically strong, and thus subject to censorship and surveillance etc.
But also it’s
cute and friendly and evokes early-internet nostalgia, which is sweet.
Mastodon
As I call it, cosy twitter.
Maybe it should be hyggr or something.
This is close to what I imagined social media would be like in the year 2000, for better and for worse.
Lots of local communities, peer-recommendation friendly, hard for a corporate overlord to influence, cute and customisable…
That said, it is a lot of work and the communities I want are not so easy to motivate into participating.
🏗
You want to have it without hosting it?
there are businesses which do it.
One obvious contender is Librem Social which hosts Mastodon and some other handy things.
USD2-USB8/month depending on your options. Not sure how the pricing scales per user.
Simon Willison’s intro is helpful: It looks like I’m moving to Mastodon.

How much I’ve spent so far running my own Mastodon server on AWS Wuite a lot; labour is not included.
Peertube
PeerTube is a federated
video sharing system, with a structure much like Mastodon and using the same
federation protocols.
Written in Typescript, if you are
curious.
I am curious how well this scales. Video is hard.]]></summary>

How citation management works in LaTeX.
BibTeX
Oh, BibTeX. The classic LaTeX-compatible citation system.
None of that faffing about making web-friendly citations is useful if you are working with academics, who don’t regard words on the internet as a real thing.
Your words must be behind a paywall where no-one can read them to count as significant.
Moreover, they must have been rendered harder to analyse by running them through LaTeX to obfuscate them into a PDF, which probably also entails using BibTeX to do the citation stuff.
Starting from Zotero, I use Better BibTeX
to make this less painful.
Sometimes one must procedurally handle annoying BibTeX problems from BibTeX files themselves

Notcompressing neural networks themselevs, but rather using them to compress other things, in the sense of using them to reconstruct things with low error, especially in concert with existing noisy data transmission pipelines.
Of course, we might try to do both at once and then think about minimum description length.
that might be interesting.

Neural networks applied to graph data.
Neural networks of course can already be represented as directed graphs, or applied to phenomena which arise from a causal graph but that is not what we mean here.
What we mean here is using information about graph topology as a feature input (and possibly output) for a neural network.
In practice this is usually some variant of applying convnets to spectral graph representations; there is an obvious analogy to generic graph computations and belief propagation but I do not know how those play our in practice.
I am not closely following this area at the moment, so be aware content m…]]></summary>
