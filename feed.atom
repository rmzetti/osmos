For as the sufferings of dimensions abound in us, so our consolation aboundeth through localisation.
Many statistical models are naturally treated as directed Bayesian networks — for example in causal inference I might naturally think about generating processes for my work as a graphical model.
Factor graphs decompose the model differently than the balls-and-arrows DAGs.
Specifically, the factor graph structures the graph with regard to how we would implement method-passing inference, rather than how we would statistically interpret the model.
The result is harder to interpret intuitively but easier to apply practically.

The matrix mathematics side of python is not so comprehensive as MATLAB.
Most of the tools are built on core matrix libraries, numpy and scipy, do what I
want mostly, but when, for example,
I really need some fancy spline type I read
about on the internet, or you want someone to have really put in some effort
on ensuring such-and-such a recursive filter is stable, Igit might find you need
to do it yourself.
numpy though gives us all the classic fortan linear algebra nlibraries.
There are several underlying numerics libraries which can be invoked from python, as with any language with a decent FFI.

Goodhart’s law is an adage named after economist Charles Goodhart, which has been phrased by Marilyn Strathern as “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”
Goodhart first advanced the idea in a 1975 article, which later became used popularly to criticize the United Kingdom government of Margaret Thatcher for trying to conduct monetary policy on the basis of targets for broad and narrow money. His original formulation was:

Stein’s method meets variational inference via kernels and probability measures.
The result is method of inference which maintains an ensemble of particles which notionally collectively sample from some target distribution.
I should learn about this, as one of the methods I might use for low-assumption Bayes inference.
Let us examine the computable kernelized Stein discrepancy, invented in Q. Liu, Lee, and Jordan (2016), weaponized in Q. Liu, Lee, and Jordan (2016) and summarised in Xu and Matsuda (2021):

Querying Glean:
Glean is a system for working with facts about source code. It is designed for collecting and storing detailed information about code structure, and providing access to the data to power tools and experiences from online IDE features to offline code analysis.
For example, Glean could answer all the questions you’d expect your IDE to answer, accurately and efficiently on a large-scale codebase. Things like:
Where is the definition of this method?
Where are all the callers of this function?
Who inherits from this class?
What are all the declarations in this file?]]></summary>

This document lists 18150 symbols and the corresponding LATEX commands that produce them.
Notionally one can compile it using the command

However AFAICT it has exceptionally heavy dependencies and requires a more-than-comprehensive LaTeX install, and thus does not work for me.

Why bike
tl;dr Riding, as compared to driving a car, makes me rich and happy. YMMV.
I ride to work, and in fact most places.1
This is a good deal.
Let me run the numbers.
My bike costs about AUD500 in maintenance per year, maybe up to AUD1000 if I want to factor in an amortized replacement cost.
Owning a small car costs about AUD6200 per year plus AUD0.16/km I drive in it, plus parking fees.
For my modest commuting needs, the fuel costs would be something like AUD500 at that price.
Parking where I work is astronomically expensive and I won’t even include it here because it would bias the numbers against cars too much.
But wait!

Drama in your home salon!
This is kinda fun, but not something I’m passionate about.
It is not owned by megacorps which is a plus.
OTOH it has a high maintenance overhead (running a server). It does not help the paranoiac reasons for choosing DIY as is not cryptographically strong, and thus subject to censorship and surveillance etc.
But also it’s
cute and friendly and evokes early-internet nostalgia, which is sweet.
Mastodon
As I call it, cosy twitter.
Maybe it should be hyggr or something.
This is close to what I imagined social media would be like in the year 2000, for better and for worse.
Lots of local communities, peer-recommendation friendly, hard for a corporate overlord to influence, cute and customisable…
That said, it is a lot of work and the communities I want are not so easy to motivate into participating.
🏗
You want to have it without hosting it?
there are businesses which do it.
One obvious contender is Librem Social which hosts Mastodon and some other handy things.
USD2-USB8/month depending on your options. Not sure how the pricing scales per user.
Simon Willison’s intro is helpful: It looks like I’m moving to Mastodon.

How citation management works in LaTeX.
BibTeX
Oh, BibTeX. The classic LaTeX-compatible citation system.
None of that faffing about making web-friendly citations is useful if you are working with academics, who don’t regard words on the internet as a real thing.
Your words must be behind a paywall where no-one can read them to count as significant.
Moreover, they must have been rendered harder to analyse by running them through LaTeX to obfuscate them into a PDF, which probably also entails using BibTeX to do the citation stuff.
Starting from Zotero, I use Better BibTeX
to make this less painful.
Sometimes one must procedurally handle annoying BibTeX problems from BibTeX files themselves

Gwern, 2013 Lewis meditation results:
A small group of Quantified Selfers tested themselves daily on arithmetic and
engaged in a month of meditation. I analyze their scores with a multilevel

longer experiment by twice as many experimenters in order to detect this

Neural networks applied to graph data.
Neural networks of course can already be represented as directed graphs, or applied to phenomena which arise from a causal graph but that is not what we mean here.
What we mean here is using information about graph topology as a feature input (and possibly output) for a neural network.
In practice this is usually some variant of applying convnets to spectral graph representations; there is an obvious analogy to generic graph computations and belief propagation but I do not know how those play our in practice.
