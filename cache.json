Bengio et al. (2022):\nGenerative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have been introduced as a method to sample a diverse set of candidates in an active learning context, with a training objective that makes them approximately sample in proportion to a given reward function. In this paper, we show a number of additional theoretical properties of GFlowNets. They can be used to estimate joint probability distributions and the corresponding marginal distributions where some variables are unspecified and, of particular interest, can represent distributions over composite objects like sets and graphs. GFlowNets amortize the work typically done by computationally expensive MCMC methods in a single but trained generative pass. They could also be used to estimate partition functions and free energies, conditional probabilities of supersets (supergraphs) given a subset (subgraph), as well as marginal distributions over all supersets (supergraphs) of a given set (graph). We introduce variations enabling the estimation of entropy and mutual information, sampling from a Pareto frontier, connections to reward-maximizing policies, and extensions to stochastic environments, continuous actions and modular energy functions.\nGenerative Flow Networks - Yoshua Bengio\nThe GFlowNet Tutorial\nMatt Biggs, The What, Why and How of Generative Flow Networks\nFlow Network based Generative Models for Non-Iterative Diverse Candidate Generation\nGFlowNet Tutorial\nReferences\n“Flow Network Based Generative Models for Non-Iterative Diverse Candidate Generation.” In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34:27381–94.

These include exponential, circular, and hyperbolic functions. Then the integral of \\(f(x) g(x)\\) can be computed in closed form with a moderate amount of work.\nThere's a formula that can compute all these related integrals in one fell swoop. (PeaseUseful1959?)\nSuppose\n\\[\nf^{\\prime \\prime}(x)=h f(x)\n\\]\nand\n\\[\ng^{\\prime \\prime}(x)=k g(x)\n\\]\nfor constants \\(h\\) and \\(k\\). …Then\n\\[\n\\int f(x) g(x) d x=\\frac{1}{h-k}\\left(f^{\\prime}(x) g(x)-f(x) g^{\\prime}(x)\\right)+C \\text {. }\n\\]\nMaclaurin integration\n(Bruda 2022)\nconsider the integral\n\\[\n\\int e^{x^2} d x\n\\]\nThe most common approach to evaluating this integral is to expand it as a power series and integrate term-by-term, which yields\n\\[\nC+x+\\frac{x^3}{3}+\\frac{x^5}{10}+\\frac{x^7}{42}+\\frac{x^9}{216}+\\cdots\n\\]\nas the antiderivative, with \\(C\\) as the constant of integration. Maclaurin Integration is an alternative solution by series (although not a power series, since it involves the function itself in the solution) that eliminates the nuisance of calculation completely.\n…the formula is simply:\n\\[\n\\int f(x) d x=-\\sum_{u=0}^{\\infty}\\left(\\frac{d^u}{d x^u}(x f(x)) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(1-x)^{n+u+1}}{\\prod_{v=1}^{u+1}(n+v)}\\right)+C,\n\\]\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.…\nThis formula is valid only if:\n1. \\(f(x)\\) is defined on the domain \\((0,2)\\),\n2. \\(f(x)\\) is continuous on \\((0,2)\\), and\n3. \\(x f(x)\\) has derivatives of all orders on \\((0,2)\\).\nReferences\n“Maclaurin Integration: A Weapon Against Infamous Integrals.” arXiv.",
