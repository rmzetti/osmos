YMMV.\nI ride to work, and in fact most places.1\nThis is a good deal.\nLet me run the numbers.\nMy bike costs about AUD500 in maintenance per year, maybe up to AUD1000 if I want to factor in an amortized replacement cost.\nOwning a small car costs about AUD6200 per year plus AUD0.16/km I drive in it, plus parking fees.\nFor my modest commuting needs, the fuel costs would be something like AUD500 at that price.\nParking where I work is astronomically expensive and I won’t even include it here because it would bias the numbers against cars too much.\nBut wait!\nThe decis…",
