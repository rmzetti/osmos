The automatically generated solvers are often as fast as handwritten, specialized solvers…\nThe GENO solver combines an Augmented Lagrangian approach with a limited memory quasi-Newton method (L-BFGS-B) that can handle also bound constraints on the variables. Quasi-Newton methods are very efficient for problems involving thousands of optimization variables. The GENO solver is then instantiated by the automatically generated methods for computing function values and gradients that are provided by this website to solve the specified class of optimization problems.

          "description": "References\n\nDiffusion Probabilistic Fields - Apple Machine Learning Research\nDiffusion probabilistic models have quickly become a major approach for generative modeling of images, 3D geometry, video and other domains. However, to adapt diffusion generative modeling to these domains the denoising network needs to be carefully designed for each domain independently, oftentimes under the assumption that data lives in a Euclidean grid.\nIn this paper we introduce Diffusion Probabilistic Fields (DPF), a diffusion model that can learn distributions over continuous functions defined over metric spaces, commonly known as fields. We extend the formulation of diffusion probabilistic models to deal with this field parametrization in an explicit way, enabling us to define an end-to-end learning algorithm that side-steps the requirement of representing fields with latent vectors as in previous approaches. We empirically show that, while using the same denoising network, DPF effectively deals with different modalities like 2D images and 3D geometry, in addition to modeling distributions over fields defined on non-Euclidean metric spaces.\nReferences\n“Objaverse: A Universe of Annotated 3D Objects.” arXiv.\n\n\nZhuang, Peiye, Samira Abnar, Jiatao Gu, Alex Schwing, Joshua M.

          "description": "References\n\nProbabilistic Numerics claims:\nProbabilistic numerics (PN) aims to quantify uncertainty arising from intractable or incomplete numerical computation and from stochastic input. This new paradigm treats a numerical problem as one of statistical inference instead. The probabilistic viewpoint provides a principled way to encode structural knowledge about a problem. By giving an explicit role to uncertainty from all sources, in particular from the computation itself, PN gives rise to new applications beyond the scope of classical methods.\nTypical numerical tasks to which PN may be applied include optimization, integration, the solution of ordinary and partial differential equations, and the basic tasks of linear algebra, e.g. solution of linear systems and eigenvalue problems.\nAs well as offering an enriched reinterpretation of classical methods, the PN approach has several concrete practical points of value. The probabilistic interpretation of computation\nallows to build customized methods for specific problems with bespoke priors\nformalizes the design of adaptive methods using tools from decision theory\nprovides a way of setting parameters of numerical methods via the Bayesian formalism\nexpedites the solution of mutually related problems of similar type\nnaturally incorporates sources of stochasticity in the computation\ncan give structural uncertainty via a probability measure compared to an error estimate\nand finally it offers a principled approach of including numerical error in the propagation of uncertainty through chains of computations.\nReferences\n“Probabilistic Numerical Methods – From Theory to Implementation.”\n\n\nHennig, Philipp, Michael A.
