Not sure how the pricing scales per user.\nSimon Willison’s intro is helpful: It looks like I’m moving to Mastodon.\nPinafore\nIntroducing Pinafore for Mastodon | Read the Tea Leaves\nWellness settings · Pinafore\nHow much I’ve spent so far running my own Mastodon server on AWS Wuite a lot; labour is not included.\nPeertube\nPeerTube is a federated\nvideo sharing system, with a structure much like Mastodon and using the same\nfederation protocols.\nWritten in Typescript, if you are\ncurious.\nI am curious how well this scales.
