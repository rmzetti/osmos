It does not help the paranoiac reasons for choosing DIY as is not cryptographically strong, and thus subject to censorship and surveillance etc.\nBut also it’s\ncute and friendly and evokes early-internet nostalgia, which is sweet.\nMastodon\nAs I call it, cosy twitter.\nMaybe it should be hyggr or something.\nThis is close to what I imagined social media would be like in the year 2000, for better and for worse.\nLots of local communities, peer-recommendation friendly, hard for a corporate overlord to influence, cute and customisable…\nThat said, it is a lot of work and the communities I want are not so easy to motivate into participating.\n🏗\nYou want to have it without hosting it?\nthere are businesses which do it.\nOne obvious contender is Librem Social which hosts Mastodon and some other handy things.\nUSD2-USB8/month depending on your options. Not sure how the pricing scales per user.\nSimon Willison’s intro is helpful: It looks like I’m moving to Mastodon.\nPinafore\nIntroducing Pinafore for Mastodon | Read the Tea Leaves\nWellness settings · Pinafore\nHow much I’ve spent so far running my own Mastodon server on AWS Wuite a lot; labour is not included.\nPeertube\nPeerTube is a federated\nvideo sharing system, with a structure much like Mastodon and using the same\nfederation protocols.\nWritten in Typescript, if you are\ncurious.\nI am curious how well this scales.
